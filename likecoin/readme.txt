Web3Press - Earn as you write, Collect as you read.

== Description ==
The best product for your fans, is your IDEA.  Web3Press publishes your posts to the blockchain, enabling you to write as usual but publish differently.

Web3Press provides a creative business model, especially for open content. No paywall or advertisement anymore. Your readers buy your posts because they love your words. Readers’ collections add a touch of class to their web3 portfolio.  If you are looking for ways to monetize, build communities with your readers and preserve your content, this plugin is for you.  

Web3Press is based on LikeCoin, an application-specific blockchain that the community and infrastructure focus on the creator’s economy.

= Why Web3 =
The Internet has been evolving in the past decades and becoming increasingly decentralized. In Web1, information was 1-way-broadcast; in Web2, information was user-generated. In Web3, the concept of ownership is applied to every piece of data. Echoing “Democratise Publishing”, the vision of WordPress, Web3Press pushes one more step forward: the freedom to OWN. Oh yes, it’s free, as in freedom.

= SELL YOUR POSTS =
Let readers support you by buying your posts while reading.  A mini NFT Widget is embedded into your WordPress posts to let readers collect their favorites.

= BE PROUD OF YOUR WORK =
Share your [NFT portfolio](https://liker.land?utm_source=WordPress) to show-off and sell your published articles.

= BUILD YOUR COMMUNITY =
Connect your fans by sending NFT gifts with warm greetings.  Publish your content to platforms like Matters.news automatically.

= PRESERVE YOUR CONTENT =
Register content metadata (ISCN) on LikeCoin chain, storing the content file on IPFS and Arweave, backup on Internet Archive, all in one plugin.

== Contribution ==

LikeCoin is an open-source project. You are welcome to contribute to the plugin on [Github](https://github.com/likecoin/likecoin-wordpress) if you are a developer.

== Installation ==

Installing the Web3Press plugin is easy-peasy. It takes only a few steps, within one minute.

Follow the below steps to install the Web3Press plugin:

1. Go to the WordPress admin panel and log in ( For example, if your website is www.abc.com, the admin panel address is usually www.abc.com/wp-admin).
2. Click on the menu on the left, go to "Plugin", and click "install plugin" on top.
3. Search for "LikeCoin" and find the LikeCoin plugin, click "Install Now" and wait for the system to finish the job, then click "Activate".
4. After installation, there will be a "LikeCoin" option in the menu. Congratulations, the installation is done!

After installing the plugin, please [install Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en), a crypto wallet Chrome extension for LikeCoin.  See the detail procedure of installing Keplr [here](https://docs.like.co/general-guides/wallet/keplr/how-to-install-keplr-extension).  The crypto wallet is necessary for you to publish and keep your Writing NFTs.

= Configuring Web3Press plugin =

You are ready to publish your post as Writing NFT after finishing the Keplr installation.  However, if you want to enjoy the like-to-earn feature further, you can also [register a Liker ID](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/liker-id/register-with-keplr).  After finishing Liker ID registration, follow the below configuration steps:

1.  On the menu, select "Your LikeCoin button", then fill in your Liker ID in the Liker ID field.
2.  Click "Confirm" to finish setting up your Writing NFT widget.  The widget will appear at the bottom of each post.

Configure the LikeCoin button to appear anywhere in the articles - use the shortcode [likecoin] to display extra LikeCoin buttons.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to collect Writing NFT? =

Collect via the "NFT widget" embedded in the content or on the user’s portfolio page.  Readers can pay by Credit/Debit card but need to install Keplr wallet to collect Writing NFT.

= How to list Writing NFT for sale? =

After installing the Web3Press plugin, writers can publish their posts as NFTs, and readers can then collect via the NFT widget.

= On what basis does the price of Writing NFT changes? =

The price changes dynamically based on the supply and demand of the NFT.  Writers do not need to set the price and quantity.  Readers do not need to set the bidding price, too; collect when the price feels right.  The market price will decrease when someone sells in the secondary market.

= I do not have Liker ID.  Can I buy or sell Writing NFT? =

Yes.  Readers can buy Writing NFT by credit/debit card or LikeCoin, but they must have Keplr installed to keep the NFT.  Writers can mint and hence list NFT for sale as long as they have enough LikeCoin in their Keplr wallet.  In both cases, Liker ID is not mandatory.

= Where can I check out my NFT collection? =

At [NFT portfolio](https://liker.land) page.

= How to sell Writing NFT in the secondary market? =

Mark the price of your NFT for sale on the NFT portfolio page.  Readers can then collect at any NFT widget.

= How to set the quantity for sale? =

There is no upper limit in principle.  However, as the market price increases as sales continue, the minting of NFT will stop automatically when the price reaches a point that is out of the market’s expectation.

= How to transfer NFT? =

It can be done at the NFT portfolio page, detail instructions [here](https://docs.like.co/general-guides/writing-nft/transfer-writing-nft).

The node takes 100% of the stake reward to let you distribute the reward to the creators you “like” via the LikeCoin button.
For details, please [refer to this guide](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/civic-liker "refer to this guide").
