LikeCoin Writing NFT.  Earn as you write, Collect as you read.

== Description ==
If you are looking for ways to monetize, store and build communities with your readers, this plugin is for you. Register content metadata on-chain, keep your content on the distributed web (IPFS & Arweave), and publish content as NFT. It is an integrated tool that allows you to write as usual but publish differently.

= NFT WIDGET =
A mini NFT marketplace is embedded into your WordPress posts to let readers collect their favorites.

= NFT PORTFOLIO =
A portfolio that can display your collected articles. Represent your readership and authorship.

= DYNAMIC PRICING =
The marketplace will determine the mint price by bonding curve. The price of Writing NFT will increase automatically after each transaction. No sales hurdle.

= DECENTRALIZED STORAGE =
Register content metadata (ISCN) on the LikeCoin chain, storing the content file on IPFS and Arweave in one plugin.

= PUBLISH TO MULTIPLE PLATFORM =
Publish your content to platforms like Matters.news and Internet Archive automatically.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to collect Writing NFT? =

Collect in "NFT widget" embedded in the content, or at the user’s portfolio page.  Readers need to install Keplr wallet and spend LikeCoin to collect NFT.

= How to list Writing NFT for sale? =

After install Writing NFT WordPress plugin, writers can publish their posts as NFTs, and readers can then collect via the NFT widget.

= On what basis the price of Writing NFT changes? =

= I do not have Liker ID, can I buy or sell Writing NFT? =

Yes.  Readers can buy Writing NFT, writers can mint and hence list NFT for sale, as long as they have enough LikeCoin in their Keplr wallet.  Liker ID is not needed.

= Where can I check out my NFT collection? =

At NFT [portfolio page](https://liker.land).

= How to sell Writing NFT in secondary market? =

Mark the price of your NFT for sale at NFT portfolio page.  Readers can then collect at any NFT widget.
