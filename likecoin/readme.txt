LikeCoin Writing NFT.  Earn as you write, Collect as you read.

== Description ==
If you are looking for ways to monetize, store and build communities with your readers, this plugin is for you. Register content metadata on-chain, keep your content on the distributed web (IPFS & Arweave), and publish content as NFT. It is an integrated tool that allows you to write as usual but publish differently.

= NFT WIDGET =
A mini NFT marketplace is embedded into your WordPress posts to let readers collect their favorites.

= NFT PORTFOLIO =
A portfolio that can display your collected articles. Represent your readership and authorship.

= DYNAMIC PRICING =
The marketplace will determine the mint price by bonding curve. The price of Writing NFT will increase automatically after each transaction. No sales hurdle.

= DECENTRALIZED STORAGE =
Register content metadata (ISCN) on the LikeCoin chain, storing the content file on IPFS and Arweave in one plugin.

== Trading LikeCoin ==

[LikeCoin tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/likecoin/) can be changed to fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The most convenient way for trading LikeCoin is on DEX (decentralized exchange) such as [Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone), which can be used immediately with a LikeCoin wallet like Keplr without registeration.

You can also trade LikeCoin on centralized exchanges such as [Liquid](https://app.liquid.com/exchange/LIKEUSDT), [DigiFinex](https://www.digifinex.com/en-ww/trade/USDT/LIKE) and [ZB.com](https://www.zb.com/en/). Information of the LikeCoin token (LIKE) can be found in [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/likecoin), [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/likecoin/) and [Big Dipper](https://likecoin.bigdipper.live/) blockchain explorer.

== Contribution ==

LikeCoin is an open-source project. You are welcome to contribute to the plugin on [Github](https://github.com/likecoin/likecoin-wordpress) if you are a developer.

Welcome to sponsor LikeCoin by being our [Civic Liker](https://liker.land/foundation/civic).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. How to collect Writing NFT?
    Collect in "NFT widget" embedded in the content, or at the user’s portfolio page.  Readers need to install Keplr wallet and spend LikeCoin to collect NFT.

2. How to list Writing NFT for sale?
    After install Writing NFT WordPress plugin, writers can publish their posts as NFTs, and readers can then collect via the NFT widget.

3. On what basis the price of Writing NFT changes?
    The price changes dynamically based on supply and demand of the NFT.  Writers do not need to set the price and quantity.  Readers do not need to set the bidding price too, just collect when the price feels right.  The marked price will decrease when someone sell in secondary market.

4. I do not have Liker ID, can I buy or sell Writing NFT?
    Yes.  Readers can buy Writing NFT, writers can mint and hence list NFT for sale, as long as they have enough LikeCoin in their Keplr wallet.  Liker ID is not needed.

5. Where can I check out my NFT collection?
    At NFT [portfolio page](https://liker.land).

6. How to sell Writing NFT in secondary market?
    Mark the price of your NFT for sale at NFT portfolio page.  Readers can then collect at any NFT widget.

7. How to set the quantity for sale?
    There is no upper limit in principle.  However, as the marked price will increase automatically as sales goes on, the minting of NFT will stop automatically when the price reaches a point that is out of market’s expectation.

    Can be done at NFT portfolio page.
