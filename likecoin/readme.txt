== Description ==

LikeCoin is an infrastructure to decentralize publishing.

Digital evidence can now be secured, validated, and made readily available in perpetuity with #DePub.

= What DePub offers =

LikeCoin aims to empower content ownership, authenticity, and provenance. Creators can register content metadata to guarantee its integrity by acquiring an [International Standard Content Number (ISCN)](https://docs.like.co/developer/international-standard-content-number-iscn). ISCN is a tool to authenticate and track content, just like a digital footprint.

= Features of LikeCoin WordPress plugin =

- Register [ISCN](https://docs.like.co/developer/international-standard-content-number-iscn), an immutable metadata registry on blockchain, for your content
- By publishing to [Matters.news](https://matters.news), store your content on [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/case-study-likecoin/) - a decentralized file system
- Monetizing your content by [LikeCoin button](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/creator). Share your Civic Liker sponsorship link to your fans for monthly subscription.

= Ready for NFT =

Bringing NFT to publishing. Register now, publish anytime. LikeCoin helps secure and freeze content metadata permanently, lock and store it in the content registry. It will allow your metadata to be accessible for future use and distribution. It can also provide a way for the public to verify that the metadata was not changed when a related NFT is minted.

= Immutable Content Registry =

ISCN is a unique identifier to catalog metadata assigned to content such as articles and images. It helps to identify the metadata - creator, date, time, location, version - of the content, akin to a book's distinctive ISBN.

= Integrated with Decentralized Storage =

Creators, curators, publishers, and readers can easily circulate and distribute content as ISCN allows for more efficient retrieval from databases. LikeCoin chain will dedicate to serve as a metadata registry, and integrate with storage like IPFS and Arweave to provide a one-click solution for users to store their content.

= Permissionless Participation =

LikeCoin operates under liquid democracy as a [DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)](https://likecoin.bigdipper.live/proposals). Anyone can publish content, build applications and participate in governance without gaining permission. No one may censor anyone.

== Trading LikeCoin ==

[LikeCoin tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/likecoin/) can be changed to fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The most convenient way for trading LikeCoin is on DEX (decentralized exchange) such as [Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone) and [Emeris](https://emeris.com/), which can be used immediately with a LikeCoin wallet like Keplr without registering any account.

You can also trade LikeCoin on centralized exchanges such as [Liquid](https://app.liquid.com/exchange/LIKEUSDT), [DigiFinex](https://www.digifinex.com/en-ww/trade/USDT/LIKE) and [ZB.com](https://www.zb.com/en/). Information of the LikeCoin token (LIKE) can be found in [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/likecoin), [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/likecoin/) and [Big Dipper](https://likecoin.bigdipper.live/) blockchain explorer.
