msgid "The heart of Decentralized Publishing is decentralized registry powered by <ISCN/>, a specification we drafted in collaboration with the industry. Inspired by ISBN for books, ISCN is a unique number assigned to content such as articles and images, and comes with metadata such as author, publisher, content address, license terms and creation footprint. Stored on <LikeCoinChain />, ISCN is immutable and censorship resilient. The content, on the other hand, is stored on <IPFS/> for tamper resistance and peer-to-peer distribution."

The <CivicLiker/> movement encourages readers to contribute USD5/mo to reward creativity and journalism, while the matching fund, distributed according to the Likes of all users, doubles the rewarding pool. With decentralized rewards, every Like counts."

msgid "Not only is LikeCoin token a reward to creators and Content Jockeys, it also serves doubly as the governing token for the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), namely the <RepublicOfLikerLand/>. Likers participate in liquid democracy by delegating their LikeCoin tokens to validators they trust, and freely switch among them without a fixed term of office. Issues such as default Content Jockeys, inflation rate and protocol updates require passing a corresponding <Proposal/> by the Republic."
